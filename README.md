# s3bGenerator
Generating block code from sb3 projects

This project is still early in development, and will be eventually turned into a solid webpage, rather than a Userscript feasting off Scratch.

## Usage

1. Install script using Tampermonkey
2. Go to ```https://scratch.mit.edu/blockify/?id=284721167``` (or use another project id)
3. It should convert the availible block data to s3blocks, and open it on the site
4. You can also add ```&json=true``` to just get the original json for the project
